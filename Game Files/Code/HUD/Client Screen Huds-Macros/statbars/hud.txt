so health is big 1

chakra is the yellow? or recolor

and the last blue one hmm fatigue gauge?

//Fatigue gauge:

when this bar is full you tend to do higher damage attacks.

when its low you tend to do basically lower damage and the odd super criticals. //what u think.

////

u want to add more bars..?


the yellow bar is stamina(we can call it fatigue now its the same thing.)

fatigue will be like running.(agility based or something)
no need to do dmg boosting anymore. we have enof of that. (personality,stats,skills)
and equipment(eventually)

no fatigue instead of energy.

//ya thats what I ment. /// just keep fatigue the same as it is for now, just for running and speed

//ah kk.
