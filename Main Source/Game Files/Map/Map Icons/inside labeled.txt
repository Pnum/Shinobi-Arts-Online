I'm gona try to label the inside buildings for you to code so it would be easier so you know where everything goes.

i color coded it

hopefully you will be able to tell the colors i know their small.

this is only if were both not online and i cant talk to u in person to tell you where everything goes.
after i do the weapon shop i think the map is ready for beta. cos the kage house, academy, hosp is ready.
(btw kage house isnt done yet. theres an upstairs and a right room. ( oh plus i added that jutsu cabinet xD so
